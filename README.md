## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is designed to simulate a turtle race where multiple users can participate. The race is driven by Python's `random` function, making it unpredictable and engaging. Once the race is over, the winner is announced through a Tkinter window.

### Key Features
- **Tkinter Interface**: User-friendly interface for entering the number of players.
- **Turtle Graphics**: Engaging race animation using the Turtle module.
- **Randomized Race**: Turtles move forward at random speeds, ensuring a fair race.
- **Winner Announcement**: The winner is displayed in a Tkinter window after the race.
